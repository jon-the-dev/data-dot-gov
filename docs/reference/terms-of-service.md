Terms of Service for

 Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA)

Document Downloads via REST API
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* * *

The Lobbing Disclosure Act (LDA), as amended, requires the Secretary of the United States Senate to make available to the public, in a downloadable manner to the extent technically practicable, all electronically filed LDA registrations and reports. These documents are offered via an Application Programming Interface (API) using Representational State Transfer (REST) and is subject to your acceptance of the terms and conditions contained herein (collectively, the "Agreement").

### Authentication

There are two ways to [authenticate](https://lda.senate.gov/api/redoc/v1/#section/Authentication) through the REST API:

* API Key (Registered)
* Unauthenticated (Anonymous)

For clients without an API Key, no special authentication is required, however anonymous clients are subject to more strict [request throttling](https://lda.senate.gov/api/redoc/v1/#section/Request-Throttling) to prevent abuse and to ensure stability. Our API is rate limited depending on the type of authentication option you choose:

* API Key (Registered): 120/minute
* Unauthenticated (Anonymous): 15/minute

### Secondary Use

Data accessed through LDA.SENATE.GOV do not, and should not, include controls over its end use. However, as the data owners or authoritative sources, the U.S. Senate Office of Public Records retains version control. Once the data have been downloaded from LDA.SENATE.GOV, the U.S. Senate cannot vouch for the quality and timeliness of any analyses conducted with retrieved data.

### Citing Data

Users of the public API should cite the date that data were accessed or retrieved using the API. Users must clearly state that "Senate Office of Public Records cannot vouch for the data or analyses derived from these data after the data have been retrieved from LDA.SENATE.GOV." The U.S. Senate Seal is protected by 18 U.S.C. § 713 and may not be used by persons who are not U.S. Senate employees or on products (including web pages) that are not U.S. Senate sponsored.

### Modification or False Representation of Content

Users may not modify or falsely represent content accessed through LDA.SENATE.GOV and still cite the source as LDA.SENATE.GOV.

### Right to Limit

Use of the APIs may be subject to certain limitations on access, calls, or use as set forth within this Agreement or otherwise provided by the U.S. Senate. If the U.S. Senate reasonably believes that a user has attempted to exceed or circumvent these limits, that user's access to the API may be permanently or temporarily blocked.

The U.S. Senate may monitor your use of its services to improve the service or to ensure compliance with this Agreement.

### Service Termination

The U.S. Senate reserves the right (though not the obligation) to (1) refuse to provide the services to a user, if it is the U.S. Senate's opinion that use violates any U.S. Senate policy, or (2) terminate or deny a user's access to and use of all or part of the services at any time for any other reason in its sole discretion. Any hosted applications may also be shut down or removed. All provisions of this Agreement, which by their nature should survive termination, shall survive termination including, without limitation, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

### Changes

The U.S. Senate reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace this Agreement, in whole or in part. Continued use of or access to the LDA.SENATE.GOV services following posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes acceptance of those modified terms. The U.S. Senate may, in the future, offer new services and/or features. Such new features and/or services shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
